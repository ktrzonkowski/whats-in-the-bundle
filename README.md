DISCLAIMER: I'm just a random person and am in no way affiliated with itch.io or any of the content creators that contributed to the bundle.

I bought the bundle because it's a great opportunity to support a cause I wholly believe in, as well as get exposure to games I might have otherwise overlooked or never even heard of.

Then I opened up the list of 742 games and went "ah crap, where do I even start."

Being the person that I am, my first instinct is to collect all the relevant data and use it to make a page I can sort and filter and search.

And that brings us to this repository.

# So what IS in the bundle?

A lot!  You can view the entire list here: https://ktrzonkowski.github.io/whats-in-the-bundle/
