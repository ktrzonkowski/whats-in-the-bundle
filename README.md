DISCLAIMER: I'm just a random person and am in no way affiliated with itch.io or any of the content creators that contributed to the bundle.

I bought the bundle because it's a great opportunity to support a cause I wholly believe in, as well as get exposure to games I might have otherwise overlooked or never even heard of.

Then I opened up the list of 742 games and went "ah crap, where do I even start."

Being the person that I am, my first instinct is to collect all the relevant data and use it to make a page I can sort and filter and search.

And that brings us to this repository.

# So what's in the bundle?

A LOT.  Please check it out before June 17, 2020!  You can help support for as little as $5 and get literally hundreds of games to try.  And if you really like a game, consider buying a copy of it to support its creator!
